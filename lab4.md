## 📌 Steps

### 1️⃣ Create a New User  
```bash
sudo useradd -m newuser


* `-m` → Creates a home directory at `/home/newuser`.

---

### 2️⃣ Create a New Group

```bash
sudo groupadd newgroup
```

---

### 3️⃣ Add User to Group

```bash
sudo usermod -aG newgroup newuser
```

* `-aG` → Appends the user to the group without removing existing ones.

---

### 4️⃣ Create a File (as current user)

```bash
touch testfile.txt
```

🔍 Check ownership:

```bash
ls -l testfile.txt
```

Example output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 0 Aug 19 14:02 testfile.txt
```

---

### 5️⃣ Assign Ownership to `newuser:newgroup`

```bash
sudo chown newuser:newgroup testfile.txt
```

---

### 6️⃣ Verify Ownership

```bash
ls -l testfile.txt
```

Expected output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 newuser newgroup 0 Aug 19 14:02 testfile.txt
```
